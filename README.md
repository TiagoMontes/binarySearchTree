# binarySearchTree

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, commonly called the left child and the right child. The tree starts with a node called the root, which is the entry point to access all other nodes in the tree. This structure is widely used in computing to store data in an organized way, facilitating operations such as search, insertion and deletion.
